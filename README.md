# Amazonka Basic Examples

A set of basic examples using [Amazonka](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka), a comprehensive Amazon Web Services SDK for Haskell.

All the examples are [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) scripts and should work out of the box once stack is installed. To keep the complexity as low as possible the script make use of [optparse-generic](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Optparse-Generic-Library) to parse command-line parameters.

The use of [Lens](https://github.com/ekmett/lens) cannot easily avoided.

Comments and contributions are most welcome.
